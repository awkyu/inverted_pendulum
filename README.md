BME 355: Biocontrols Project

This project was intended on solidifying my knowledge on basic control principles.  The goal was to create a PID controller for an inverted pendulum that starts balanced, but is thrown off by a sudden force. This is a common controls problem, especially in the field of bipedal robotics where walking is commonly modelled as an inverted pendulum.

Currently Pack Bionics is working on taking this a step further by adding a real model, adding a swing-up control, and by testing other control methods (LQR for example).  Again, you can visit the Pack Bionics Github page for more details.
